## :rocket: Introduction

The goal of the project is to enrich your minishell1 project by adding semicolons (‘;’), pipes (‘|’), and the four
redirections (‘>’, ‘<’, ‘»’, ‘«’) management.

If the executable cannot be found, you must display an error message and display the prompt again.
Errors must be dealt with and must display the appropriate message on the error output.

You must correctly handle the PATH and the environment (by copying and restoring the initial env).

You must implement the following builtins: cd, setenv, unsetenv, env, exit.
Your env builtin hasn’t to take any argument. Your unsetenv builtin hasn’t to support the “*” wildcard.
